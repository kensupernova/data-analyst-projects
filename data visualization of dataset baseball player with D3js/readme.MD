<b>Summary</b>:
<p>This dataset contains the handedness, height, weight, batting average, home run of 1158 baseball players. This data visualization shows how the batting average and home run count are related with the handedness, height and weight of players.  
</p>

<b>Design</b>:
<p>The chart is a scatter plot. The physical features of each player are ploted on the X axis; the sports performance are ploted on the Y axis. The difference between handedness is representated by the color of data points. The chart is intended to show the correlation between HR vs weight, HR vs height, avg vs weight, avg height, HR vs avg. A line is drawn to show the agression between the current plotted varirables. A list of buttons will be included to provide the options to see different plots. The 'clicked' status of the button is represented by the background and font color. Another button is also drawn to show difference between right handed and left handed.

User 1: "Handedness" button do not respond when cliked repeatedly. 
</p>

<p>
User 2: When Yaxis is 'avg', the scale is not wrong. Too much white space on the top.
The axis label should not be abbreviated, otherwise the chart can not tell the story itself. The fontsize of ticks should be bigger.
</p>

<p>
User 3: The axis has not units. The description should include the findings. I do not know what the chart is trying to present.
